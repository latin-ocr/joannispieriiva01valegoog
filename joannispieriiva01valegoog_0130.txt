Joarras Pmnrns Vannnrarns (Giovan Pietro
Bolzoni l, was of the ancient family of Bormum
and was born at Belluno in the Venetian Statcs
,in 1477. The poverty of his family, which occu-
pied him in domestic services, did not permit
him to apply to literature till the age of fifteen

years. His relation Urbano Bolzani, who was -

preceptor to Leo X, drew him from his oh-'
scurity, aud assisted his education. His progrcss
was so rapid, that he soon formed afriendship
'with the celebrated Men of Letters; and espe-
cially with Cardinal Bemho. ¹- Leo X, and Cle-
ment VII shewed much esteem for him; and
proved it hy their conduct towards him. Pierius
preferriug study‚ and an honourable mediocrity
to all that could distract his attention from

it, refused the Bishopric of Capodistria‚ and
¹ that of Aviguon‚ and contented himself with
the place ol Apostolical Prothonotary. Yet he
undertoolr tlte task of many important negocia·
tinus, which he execnted with honour.

He¹ died at Padua in the 61.st year of his age,
25 Dec. 1558. ’
